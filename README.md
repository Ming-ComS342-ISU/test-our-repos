we can put the instructions for submitting homework and other useful things related strictly to homework in this top level readme right here.

Important!!

As you can see the file structure is as follows:

- [x] homework-X/README.md   - can contain problem text for the Xth homework
- [x] homework-X/answer-sheets   - contains the answer sheets and tests for the given homework
- [x] homework-X/official-solution - will contain the solutions we release after the deadline


Now, after the students pull the homework they should put their solution in:
 - [x] homework-X/student-solution   - by following this convention we minimize (almost eliminate) any source for merge conflicts when the students will have to pull the official-solutions.
